1. What is in your data?
<br>
Our dataset consists of information about social media usage and emotional wellbeing. Social media usage (Daily_Usage_Time (minutes)) is straightforward and displayed in minutes while emotional wellbeing refers to dominant emotions - such as anger, happiness, and sadness - felt during the day. On top of both of these variables, the other values in this dataset are: User_ID, Age, Gender, Platform, Posts_Per_Day, Likes_Received_Per_Day, Comments_Received_Per_Day, and Messages_Sent_Per_Day.

3. How will these data be useful for studying the phenomenon you're interested in?
<br>
This data will be useful to understand how different factors affect the dominant emotion when using social media. For example, the amount of time spent on social media or the platform may affect users’ mood. Platforms such as Instagram may lead to comparison or feelings of inadequacy. It would be interesting to see how people engaging with different media affects their mood.

5. What are the challenges you've resolved or expect to face in using them?
<br>
Some challenges that we have faced are data values not being in the expected columns. For example, values in the Age and Gender columns were swapped. Some more challenges that we anticipate are the rows not having complete values, extra values, or strange values. 
Besides difficulties with the data values, there may be some bias in the gathering of the data. For example, only people who use social media are participants, so you cannot compare those who don’t use social media to those who do. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about how social media may affect emotional state. Moreover, quantifying the dominant emotional state is subjective and not completely reliable.
